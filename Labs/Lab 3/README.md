## Summary
For this lab to work, I had to download python and additional python packages so the code would work. When installing python windows had an auto redirect to the microsoft store for it rather than using the download directly from the website, so even after adding python to my path, I stil had to go to app settings and turn off the redirect in app execution aliases. Downloading the additionally packages was easy however it was as simple as making sure I had pip installed and then running python -m pip install jdcal astral geopy pytz psutil.
