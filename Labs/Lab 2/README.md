## Summary
For this lab to work, I set up a deepseek instance on chrome and told it to tell me about the commands I was about to test, this was I could see if whether the commands were linux/mac only and could find windows equivlant ones fast. Deepseek was also able to explain to me what each one did which helped me better understand what these commands did along with actually testing them. I feel i have a better understanding of the command prompt.
